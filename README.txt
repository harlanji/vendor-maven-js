This project is a set of maven builds for various Javascript artifacts that 
do not currently have builds published in a public repository. All artifacts
will go under the com.soashable.vendor package for now, until they are picked
up and released by the upstream source.

All source is downloaded from the source vendors. Releases are made to 
the Sonatype Nexus OSS repository.
